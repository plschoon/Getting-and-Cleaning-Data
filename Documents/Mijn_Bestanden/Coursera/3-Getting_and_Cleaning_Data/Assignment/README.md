COURSE PROJECT
================================================================================================================================================
Aim and Objectives
================================================================================================================================================
Companies like FitBit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 
The data linked are collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

The aim of the project is to clean and extract usable data and to submit an R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
